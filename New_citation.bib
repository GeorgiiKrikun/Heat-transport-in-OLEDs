abstract = {PURPOSE: The purpose of this article is to provide a review of the competencies and associated assessment techniques relevant to the practice of anesthesiology. Although many of the competencies are difficult to define and measure specifically, advances in assessment techniques have provided more opportunities to gather meaningful performance data. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Establishing the competence of anesthesiologists demands a host of measures, including standardized tests and less-structured peer evaluations. Simulation-based assessment will play an increasingly important role both in certification and in maintenance of certification for anesthesiologists. CONCLUSIONS: While there are many psychometric challenges associated with the assessments pertinent to the education of anesthesiologists, technological advances combined with an increased awareness of sound measurement principles will yield more meaningful competency measures that can be used to improve the practice of anesthesiology.},

abstract = {Charge carrier mobility is a figure of merit commonly used to rate organic semiconducting materials for their suitability in applications such as solid-state lighting or photovoltaics. Although large variations are found in published mobility values on identical materials, there is little open discussion in the literature of the reproducibility of these results. We address this with an interlaboratory study of mobility measurements performed on a set of organic semiconductors using the space-charge limited current method. We found mobility measured on nominally identical devices could vary by more than one order of magnitude, with the largest sources of variation being poor electrodes and film thickness variation. Moreover, we found that mobility values extracted from identical data by different scientists would typically vary by a factor of 3. We propose a protocol for analysis and reporting that was found to reduce this analysis variation to as little as 20{\%}. We also present general guidelines for improving the reproducibility of benchmark mobility measurements. {\textcopyright} 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

We specifically considered cases in which the energy barrier to injection of electrons is much larger than that for holes so that holes dominate the current flow in the device. Charge injection into the organic material occurs by thermionic emission and by tunneling. For Schottky energy barriers less than about 0.3–0.4 eV, for typical organic LED device parameters, the current flow is space charge limited and the electric field in the structure is highly nonuniform. For larger energy barriers the current flow is injection limited. In the injection limited regime, the net injected charge is relatively small, the electric field is nearly uniform, and space charge effects are not important. At smaller bias in the i...},

This assumes static defects, implies quasi-instantaneous interactions and at least some momentum transfer. However, when defect dynamics are explicitly included, the nature of phonon-defect interactions becomes more subtle. Ab initio microcanonical molecular-dynamics simulations show that (1) spatially localized vibrational modes (SLMs), associated with all types of defects in semiconductors, can trap thermal phonons; (2) the vibrational lifetimes of excitations in SLMs are one to two orders of magnitude longer (dozens to hundreds of periods of oscillation) than those of bulk phonons of similar frequency; (3) it is phonon trapping by defects (in SLMs) rather than bulk phonon scattering, which reduces the flow of heat; and (4) the decay of trapped phonons and therefore heat flow can be predicted and controlled—at least to some extent—by the use of carefully selected...},

abstract = {For lighting applications, organic light-emitting diodes (OLED) need much higher brightness than for displays, leading to self-heating. Due to the temperature-activated transport in organic semiconductors, this can result in brightness inhomogeneities and catastrophic failure. Here, it is shown that due to the strong electrothermal feedback of OLEDs, the common spatial current and voltage distribution is completely changed, requiring advanced device modeling and operation concepts. This study clearly demonstrates the effect of S-shaped negative differential resistance in OLEDs induced by self-heating. As a consequence, for increasing voltage, regions with declining voltages are propagating through the device, and even more interestingly, a part of these regions show even decreasing currents, leading to strong local variation in luminance. The expected breakthrough of OLED lighting technology will require an improved price performance ratio, and the realization of modules with very high brightness but untainted appearance is considered to be an essential step into this direction. Thus, a deeper understanding of the control of electrothermal feedback will help to make OLEDs in lighting more competitive.},

Only the energetic disorder effects are taken into consideration, and polaronic effects are neglected. Both the exact (approach I) and approximate (approach II) Miller-Abrahams expressions were used to describe the carrier jump rates. In previous studies mainly approach II, which ignores phonon emission, was used. We show that only approach I provides correct results for temperature and electric-field dependences of mobility in solids with particularly low energetic disorder. Further, we show that in the case of a small degree of disorder, sigma/k(B)T, the temperature and field dependences of the charge mobility are much weaker than for larger disorder. Theoretical predictions are in quantitative agreement with the experimental observation in a pi-conjugated polymer with weak energetic disorder.},

abstract = {Temperature-activated charge transport in disordered organic semiconductors at large carrier concentrations, especially relevant in organic field-effect transistors (OFETs), has been thoroughly considered using a recently developed analytical formalism assuming a Gaussian density-of-states (DOS) distribution and Miller- Abrahams jump rates. We demonstrate that the apparent Meyer-Neldel compensation rule (MNR) is recovered regarding the temperature dependences of the charge carrier mobility upon varying the carrier concentration but not regarding varying the width of the DOS. We show that establishment of the MNR is a characteristic signature of hopping transport in a random system with variable carrier concentration. The polaron formation was not involved to rationalize this phenomenon. The MNR effect has been studied in a OFET based on C60 films, a material with negligible electron-phonon coupling, and successfully described by the present model. We show that this phenomenon is entirely due to the evolution of the occupational DOS profile upon increasing carrier concentration and this mechanism is specific to materials with Gaussian-shaped DOS. The suggested model provides compact analytical relations which can be readily used for the evaluation of important material parameters from experimentally accessible data on temperature dependence of the mobility in organic elec- tronic devices. Experimental results on temperature-dependent charge mobility reported before for organic semiconductors by other authors can be well interpreted by using the model presented in this paper. In addition, the presented analytical formalism predicts a transition to a Mott-type charge carrier hopping regime at very low temperatures, which also manifests a MNR effect.},

By means of a two-dimensional drift-diffusion model, we explicitly consider thermionic and tunneling injection in combination with subsequent carrier transport into the device. Based on numerical simulations with this model, we determine the contact resistance as a function of the nominal hole injection barrier height and temperature. Depending on the barrier height or the operating temperature, we find three distinct injection regimes. Our work reveals that in all three regimes self-regulating processes exist due to which the influx of current is adjusted according to the needs of the channel at the given point of operation. We explain why the transmission/transfer line method (TLM) for the determination of the contact resistance,Rc, quantitatively fails for non-quasi-ohmic injection. Self-regulation links the contact resistance to the channel resistance and the contact resistance becomes dependent on the channel length. For larger channel lengths,Rcis underestimated by TLM; the method yields overestimated values for small channel devices. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Recent measurements have revealed poor thermal transport across interfaces between two dissimilar materials, e.g., organic semiconductors and metals. In such systems, the interfacial thermal conductance G(b) is dominated by the strength of interfacial bonding, but existing analytical models still fail to accurately predict G(b) especially for organic-metal interfaces. Growing interest in this research area calls for comprehensive understanding of interfacial thermal transport across hybrid material interfaces. Here we demonstrate that spatial nonuniformity has to be assessed in the calculation of G(b) for interfaces with partial coverage or incommensurate growth that is characteristic of these interfaces. The interface between copper phthalocyanine and fcc metals (Ag, Al, and Au) exhibits a sixfold difference between the metal's (similar to 4-angstrom) and the organic molecule's (similar to 25-angstrom) lattice constant. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal the spatial variation in G(b), and a model is developed that considers the spatial variations in phonon transmission, successfully predicting G(b) for many organic-metal interfaces.},

abstract = {In recent years great effort has been put into development of lighting purpose Organic Light Emitting Diodes (OLEDs) worldwide. Among many concerns of developers is heat-removal from the thin film structure of the active layers of OLEDs which are typically realized on low thermal conductivity substrates such as glass or polymer foils. The other issue is to provide the OLEDs with transparent, yet high electrical conductivity electric power supply structure, therefore metallic shunting grids are added to the layer stack of OLEDs. These two major issues necessitate self-consistent electro-thermal simulation of large area OLEDs in which the temperature dependent I–V characteristics of the light emitting polymer layers are also considered. Our first article discussed the details of the algorithmic fundamentals of our nonlinear electro-thermal field solver. This second paper presents the new, temperature dependent radiance and luminance distribution map calculation extension of the algorithm. Using this feature the inhomogeneity of large area OLEDs in free convection environment can be estimated; such calculations for glass-based research OLED samples are also presented. Because of the operational degradation of the OLED, non-emissive “dark” spots can appear. Cause of these spots can be e.g. manufacturing problem, damage of the surface protection, etc. Electro-thermal and luminance simulation of this failure type is demonstrated and is compared with measured results. Thermal runaway as the possible physical phenomenon behind the appearances of dark spots is proved by simulations.},

Two different PhOLEDs, one with a single host, 4,4′-Bis(carbazol-9-yl)biphenyl, and the other with an exciplex-forming co-host, are studied. Trap-assisted recombination with a large number of trapped charges is dominant in the PhOLED with the single host because of the large energy gap between the host and the dopant state. In contrast, bimolecular Langevin recombination is dominant in the PhOLED with the exciplex forming co-host, where a phosphorescent dye is doped in the co-host. As a result, the accumulated charge density is lower in the co-host system than in the single host emission layer, leading to high efficiency that approaches the theoretical limit, with an extremely low efficiency roll-off.},

Ag has the highest reflectivity for visible light among all metals, yet its hole-injection properties are not ideal for anodes of top-emitting OLED. The performance of the devices is significantly improved using the molybdenum oxide as anode buffer layer at the surface of Ag. By introducing the molybdenum oxide, the hole injection from Ag anodes into top-emitting OLED is largely enhanced with rather high reflectivity retained. {\textcopyright} 2012 Tianjin University of Technology and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

The proposed model can well explain the Seebeck feature of the polymers with approaching disorder-free transport, as well as that of the organic semiconductors with the general disorder.

It is demonstrated that the TFE combined with a flexible heat sink shows better thermal performance, compared with the epoxy-filled glass encapsulation and the conventional glass encapsulation. By way of experiments and simulations, we verify that the multi-heterojunction configuration and the low thermal conductivity of the polymer layer in the TFE film have no impact on the thermal performance. Furthermore, we find through simulations that a significant temperature gradient appears inside the TFE layers only when the thermal conductivity of the polymer is lower than 1×10−3W/mK. This enables us to perform design optimization of the TFE configuration with relaxed heat dissipation.},

abstract = {We investigate the effects of auxiliary metal electrodes on the optical and thermal properties of large-area (30 × 120 mm2) opaque and transparent white OLED lighting panels. Enlarging their emission area inevitably entails a non-uniform current distribution due to the limiting conductivity of transparent electrodes, causing local heat generation. To tackle it, we have used grid patterned Cr, Mo/Al/Mo, or Cu metal lines (0.15 mm in width) as auxiliary metal electrodes on an ITO anode. Among those, Cu metal grids exhibit the highest luminous efficacy with the least heat generation, and the most uniform light distribution by virtue of its lowest sheet resistance, followed by Mo/Al/Mo and then Cr metal grids. It is also found that local heat generation appears more seriously in large-area transparent OLED panels. With attempt to suppress it, we have also deposited Al metal lines (2 mm in width) on a semitransparent Al/Ag cathode by thermal evaporation, which brings in a highly uniform heat distribution. Furthermore, we study the effect of the shape of the light-emitting area on the luminance and heat distributions. A round-shaped OLED panel with a hexagonal metal grid exhibits highly homogeneous luminance and surface temperature distributions. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

OLEDs were fabricated on polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyimide (PI), and glass substrates, and the instantaneous and time-resolved performances of the OLEDs were compared. The device operation temperature (T) was predicted via heat transfer analysis using the finite element method (FEM). The value of T during operation was experimentally measured using an infrared (IR) camera, and the results were compared with the numerically calculated values. The effects of T on the time-resolved electroluminescence (EL) spectra of the OLEDs on the different substrates were also investigated. The experimental results of this study agreed well with the numerical predictions that the T of the OLEDs on the polymers are higher than the T of the OLEDs on glass during operation due to the relatively low thermal diffusivity ($\alpha$) of the polymer substrates used in this study. The results also showed that the performance and reliability of the flexible OLEDs (f-OLED) are highly dependent on the heat extraction capabilities of the substrates; thus, the current density (J), luminescence (L), voltage (V) characteristics, and efficiencies ($\eta$) over time of the OLEDs on PET and PI are inferior to the OLEDs on the glass substrate.},

abstract = {Accurate modeling of electron-hole recombination in organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) is essential for developing a complete description of their functioning. Traditionally, the recombination rate is described by the Langevin formula, with a proportionality factor equal to the sum of the electron and hole mobilities. In the disordered organic semiconductors used in OLEDs these mobilities have been shown to depend strongly on the carrier densities and on the electric field. Moreover, the energetic disorder leads to percolating pathways for the electron and hole currents, which may or may not be correlated. To answer the question whether the Langevin formula is still valid under such circumstances we perform Monte Carlo simulations of the recombination rate for Gaussian energetic disorder. We vary the disorder energy, the temperature, the densities, and mobility ratio of electrons and holes, the electric field, and the type of correlation between the electron and hole energies. We find that at zero electric field the Langevin formula is surprisingly well obeyed, provided that a change in the charge-carrier mobilities due to the presence of charge carriers of the opposite type is taken into account. Deviations from the Langevin formula at finite electric field are small at the field scale relevant for OLED modeling.},

Pasveer et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 94, 206601 (2005)]. For the device simulations, a numerically efficient one-dimensional continuum drift-diffusion device model has been developed, which is also applicable to any other disorder-induced carrier density and field dependence of the mobility and diffusion coefficient. The device and material parameters chosen are relevant to organic fight-emitting diode (OLED) applications. It is shown that a realistic degree of disorder can give rise to apparent mobilities that vary over more than 2 orders of magnitude with the layer thickness if the current-voltage curves are (incorrectly) analyzed in terms of the often-used drift-only Mott-Gurney formula. This implies that meaningful analyses of transport in OLEDs should be based on the full functional dependence of the mobility on the carrier density and field, induced by the disorder.},
