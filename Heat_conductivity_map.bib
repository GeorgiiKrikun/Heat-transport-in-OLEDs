abstract = {Joule heating and its impact on the brightness homogeneity are investigated since the luminance distribution is a key issue in large area organic light emitting diodes. In addition to previous reports, it is also important to consider the device temperature as a main factor for determining the luminance homogeneity. At a luminance of 1000 cd/m(2) the active area reaches an average temperature of 40.6 degrees C and a peak of 46.2 degrees C. The increased device temperature is leading to higher local current densities resulting in a reduced brightness homogeneity. Modeling confirms these results and can be used for further device layout optimization. (c) 2007 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {For lighting applications, organic light-emitting diodes (OLED) need much higher brightness than for displays, leading to self-heating. Due to the temperature-activated transport in organic semiconductors, this can result in brightness inhomogeneities and catastrophic failure. Here, it is shown that due to the strong electrothermal feedback of OLEDs, the common spatial current and voltage distribution is completely changed, requiring advanced device modeling and operation concepts. This study clearly demonstrates the effect of S-shaped negative differential resistance in OLEDs induced by self-heating. As a consequence, for increasing voltage, regions with declining voltages are propagating through the device, and even more interestingly, a part of these regions show even decreasing currents, leading to strong local variation in luminance. The expected breakthrough of OLED lighting technology will require an improved price performance ratio, and the realization of modules with very high brightness but untainted appearance is considered to be an essential step into this direction. Thus, a deeper understanding of the control of electrothermal feedback will help to make OLEDs in lighting more competitive.},

abstract = {We investigate the effects of auxiliary metal electrodes on the optical and thermal properties of large-area (30 ?? 120 mm 2) opaque and transparent white OLED lighting panels. Enlarging their emission area inevitably entails a non-uniform current distribution due to the limiting conductivity of transparent electrodes, causing local heat generation. To tackle it, we have used grid patterned Cr, Mo/Al/Mo, or Cu metal lines (0.15 mm in width) as auxiliary metal electrodes on an ITO anode. Among those, Cu metal grids exhibit the highest luminous efficacy with the least heat generation, and the most uniform light distribution by virtue of its lowest sheet resistance, followed by Mo/Al/Mo and then Cr metal grids. It is also found that local heat generation appears more seriously in large-area transparent OLED panels. With attempt to suppress it, we have also deposited Al metal lines (2 mm in width) on a semitransparent Al/Ag cathode by thermal evaporation, which brings in a highly uniform heat distribution. Furthermore, we study the effect of the shape of the light-emitting area on the luminance and heat distributions. A round-shaped OLED panel with a hexagonal metal grid exhibits highly homogeneous luminance and surface temperature distributions. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Although many of the competencies are difficult to define and measure specifically, advances in assessment techniques have provided more opportunities to gather meaningful performance data. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Establishing the competence of anesthesiologists demands a host of measures, including standardized tests and less-structured peer evaluations. Simulation-based assessment will play an increasingly important role both in certification and in maintenance of certification for anesthesiologists. CONCLUSIONS: While there are many psychometric challenges associated with the assessments pertinent to the education of anesthesiologists, technological advances combined with an increased awareness of sound measurement principles will yield more meaningful competency measures that can be used to improve the practice of anesthesiology.},

@article{Davids1997,
abstract = {We present a unified device model for single layer organic light emitting diodes (LEDs) which includes charge injection, transport, and space charge effects in the organic material. The model can describe both injection limited and space charge limited current flow and the transition between them. We specifically considered cases in which the energy barrier to injection of electrons is much larger than that for holes so that holes dominate the current flow in the device. Charge injection into the organic material occurs by thermionic emission and by tunneling. For Schottky energy barriers less than about 0.3-0.4 eV, for typical organic LED device parameters, the current flow is space charge limited and the electric field in the structure is highly nonuniform. For larger energy barriers the current flow is injection limited. In the injection limited regime, the net injected charge is relatively small, the electric field is nearly uniform, and space charge effects are not important. At smaller bias in the injection limited regime, thermionic emission is the dominant injection mechanism. For this case the thermionic emission injection current and a backward flowing interface recombination current, which is the time reversed process of thermionic emission, combine to establish a quasi-equilibrium carrier density. The quasi-equilibrium density is bias dependent because of image force lowering of the injection barrier. The net device current is determined by the drift of these carriers in the nearly constant electric field. The net device current is much smaller than either the thermionic emission or interface recombination current which nearly cancel. At higher bias, injection is dominated by tunneling. The bias at which tunneling exceeds thermionic emission depends on the size of the Schottky energy barrier. When tunneling is the dominant injection mechanism, a combination of tunneling injection current and the backflowing interface recombination current combine to establish the carrier density. We compare the model results with experimental measurements on devices fabricated using the electroluminescent conjugated polymer poly[2-methoxy, 5-(2{\^{a}}€²-ethyl-hexyloxy)-1,4-phenylene vinylene] which by changing the contacts can show either injection limited behavior or space charge limited behavior. {\^{A}}{\textcopyright} 1997 American Institute of Physics.},

We present a general analytical model to describe the Seebeck effect for organic semiconductors based on the hopping transport and percolation theory. The proposed model can well explain the Seebeck feature of the polymers with approaching disorder-free transport, as well as that of the organic semiconductors with the general disorder. The simulated results imply that the Seebeck coefficient in the organic semiconductors would happen to transfer from temperature dependence to temperature independence with the decrease of the energetic disorder.},

abstract = {We theoretically investigate the carrier injection into top-contact bottom-gate organic thin film transistors. By means of a two-dimensional drift-diffusion model, we explicitly consider thermionic and tunneling injection in combination with subsequent carrier transport into the device. Based on numerical simulations with this model, we determine the contact resistance as a function of the nominal hole injection barrier height and temperature. Depending on the barrier height or the operating temperature, we find three distinct injection regimes. Our work reveals that in all three regimes self-regulating processes exist due to which the influx of current is adjusted according to the needs of the channel at the given point of operation. We explain why the transmission/transfer line method (TLM) for the determination of the contact resistance, Rc, quantitatively fails for non-quasi-ohmic injection. Self-regulation links the contact resistance to the channel resistance and the contact resistance becomes dependent on the channel length. For larger channel lengths, Rc is underestimated by TLM; the method yields overestimated values for small channel devices. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},
